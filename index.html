      <p>
         Reading books provides a level of depth in the development of the
         narrative and characters which is often missing in movies. Books enable readers to
         grapple with complex ideas and feelings at their own pace, by placing themselves 
         in the mind of the character. These interactions can create deeper relationships 
         with the plot or setting and bring out the main themes of the novel. Book lovers,
         on the other hand, are able to enjoy benefits like improved cognitive function
         and an increased vocabulary. It also fosters critical thinking and nurtures empathy, 
         the skill gained by the reader shortcut through the shoes of various people as well as 
         through the cultures imageries. Books also allow one to get away from reality, providing
         an exile for them to play with other worlds and time and after a read well done the people 
         can labor the new solutions. If reading is the cost, the profits are surely there.
         Besides this, having a book as a tactile object and also the scent of the paper can
         make us to remember old times, it also can coddle us. In addition, people are exposed to
         new worlds thanks to the power of the narrative that the reader lives in his/her imagination
         by picturing each different character (in the way he/she wants) and thus establishing a personal
         bond to the st.

        <h2><u>Argument for Watching Movies</u></h2>

         <p>
            The use of films provides sensing through the arts as well as listening. Through music, cinematography, 
            and acting, films make the audience experience the emotions and themes portrayed, thereby creating a 
            multi-sensory experience that arrests the attention of the audience. It leads to the audience, making 
            them a more active part of the story than just telling. Also, the films can be a link between the 
            different cultures and languages, thus, they can be understandable by other people that are not 
            familiar with them. The visual medium gives the possibility to describe action sequences or feelings 
            whose depiction in text could be quite problematic. For the audience that cannot read well or have 
            little time to read, movies are a straightforward yet intriguing way of exploring stories. While books 
            delve into the inner aspects of characters, movies provide a social experience - group watching of 
            films lead to connections and discussions. A movie that is watched together creates the shared 
            experience, which later the friends and family talk about it with joy and understanding.
